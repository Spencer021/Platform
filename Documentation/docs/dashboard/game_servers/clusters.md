Clusters help organise game servers and have a functional reason for games that support clusters.

[Go to Clusters >](https://dash.gameserverapp.com/cluster)

## Cluster chat
Cluster chat allows players to chat even when they are on different game servers. Not all games support cluster chat. See the [features list per game](https://dash.gameserverapp.com/features-per-game) for more information.

By default cluster chat is not enabled. Manage cluster chat settings by clicking `Cluster chat` in the sidebar menu, on the right.

Enable the `Cluster chat` switch to enable cluster chat. __No game server restarts required.__

### Global chat
Share cluster chat among all clusters by enabling Global chat. This automatically shares the cluster chat messages with the other clusters that have `Global chat` enabled too.

### Cluster chat format
The `Cluster chat format` field allows for customising how the cluster chat is displayed in-game. Use the variables below:

#### Available variables

- `{charname}` is replaced with name of character that posted the chat
- `{servername}` is replaced with name of server the chat came from
- `{groupname}` is replace with name of character's group
- `{message}` is used to determine where the actual chat message is placed

### Discord + Cluster chat
In addition to talking to players on other game servers is it also possible to talk to in-game players from Discord.

### Reorder game servers in cluster
Change the order of game servers in a cluster. This changes the order for the cluster for all admins.

![Clusters - change game server order in cluster](/img/dashboard/gameserver/clusters/cluster_change_server_order.jpg)

Change the order by dragging the game servers up / down.

### Cluster ID
Some games need a `cluster ID` in order to cluster together game servers. GameServerApp automatically configures the `cluster ID` in those cases. You don't have to do anything.
